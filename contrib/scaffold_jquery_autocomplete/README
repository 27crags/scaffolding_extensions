If you are using JQuery javascript library with the plugin, you need to use this
plugin for autocomplete functionality.  It's a modification of jquery-Autocomplete
[1].  To use this plugin, include the css file as a stylesheet, the gif in the
same directory as the stylesheet, and the js file as a script (in addition to
JQuery itself).
