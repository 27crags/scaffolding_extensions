This allows you to add a scaffolded autocomplete type that does not rely on
any associations.  It's useful if you have a denormalized database and need
auto completion of fields where many values in the field are the same.

To use this, make sure you are using the default javascript files in the
layout:

  <%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>

Also, make sure you have an auto_complete_for action in the controller:

  auto_complete_for :model, :field
  
In the model, make sure the column type for the field is :autocomplete:

  @scaffold_column_types = {'name'=>:autocomplete}

Then apply the patch to the plugin (or modify it manually):

  cd RAILS_ROOT/vendor/plugins/scaffolding_extensions
  patch -p0 < contrib/scaffold_auto_complete_without_association/scaffolding_extensions.rb.patch

If you are using Rails 2.0, you'll need to add the auto_complete plugin, found
at http://dev.rubyonrails.org/browser/plugins/auto_complete.
