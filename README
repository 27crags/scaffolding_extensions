ScaffoldingExtensions
=====================

TODO:
scaffold_includes - symbols to include when scaffolding (so scaffold name doesn't generate extra queries)
scaffold - add :except and :only options, for specifying only certain actions being added
scaffold_search, scaffold_merge, scaffold_habtm - Take symbols instead of classes
render_*_scaffold - Use common code instead of having different functions
scaffold_search, scaffold_merge = combine into scaffold?
