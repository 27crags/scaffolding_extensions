The DataMapper module has some quirks, mainly:

1. For models that have the "storage_name" explicitly defined,
   the "has n, :through => Resource" relation doesn't work well.
   Don't use models, that have non-standard table names, or
   create the habtm resource by hand (check the test application)

2. Because DataMapper uses a module instead of a superclass, you have
   to add the appropriate scaffolding_extensions modules by hand.
   The simplest way is to use the `add_scaffolding_methods` method in
   your controller, or initialization script:

   class Dm < Merb::Controller
     add_scaffolding_methods [DmOfficer, DmMeeting, DmEmployee, DmGroup, DmPosition]
     scaffold DmOfficer
     scaffold DmMeeting
     scaffold_all_models :only =>[DmEmployee, DmGroup, DmPosition]
   end

You need dm-core, dm-validations, dm-transactions to use scaffolding
extensions with datamapper.  You also need do_sqlite3 in order to run
the test_suite for scaffolding_extensions with datamapper.
