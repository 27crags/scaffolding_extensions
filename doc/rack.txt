Scaffolding Extensions includes a native rack adapter that can run
directly on top of rack with no framework in between.  However, this
mode does not support custom layouts or views.

Here's an simple example of use:

  require 'sequel'
  require 'models/employee'
  require 'scaffolding_extensions'
  require 'scaffolding_extensions/controller/rack'
  
  class SequelRack < ScaffoldingExtensions::RackController
    scaffold Employee
  end
  
  puts "ScaffoldingExtensions::Rack started on port 7974"
  Rack::Handler.get('mongrel').run(app, :Host=>'0.0.0.0', :Port=>7974) do |server|
    trap(:INT) do
      server.stop
      puts "\nScaffoldingExtensions::Rack shutdown"
    end
  end
