Sinatra doesn't have a defined folder structure for models, so
scaffold_all_models shouldn't be used unless you pass the :only option, which
gives a list of models to scaffold.

Sinatra has a defined structure for plugins.  To use it, put the plugin in the
vendor directory of your application and it should be picked up automatically.
Note that if you doing something Sinatra doesn't like (such as using ruby-style
to deploy the Sinatra application, or just changing $0), this probably won't
work, so you need to require it manually.

To use the plugin if installing the gem:

  require 'scaffolding_extensions'

To use the plugin, just call one of the root level scaffold methods with the
path at which you want the plugin mounted:

  scaffold '/admin', Model1
  scaffold_habtm '/admin', Model1, :things
  scaffold_all_models '/admin', :only=>[Model1, Model2, Model3]
