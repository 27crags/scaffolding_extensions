Unlike Rails, Ramaze has no defined structure for plugins.  I recommend adding
it to the root of the Ramaze application, though any subdirectory should work.

Assuming you areusing the recommended defaults (models are located in
model/*.rb), add the following to your runner (start.rb):

  $:.unshift('scaffolding_extensions/lib')
  require 'scaffolding_extensions'
  
If your models are located somewhere else, it is easiest to let Scaffolding
Extensions know about them manually (this is only necessary if you are using
scaffold_all_models without :only):

  ScaffoldingExtensions.all_models = [Model1, Model2, Model3]

You should add this code after your models have been loaded but before your
controllers have been loaded.
