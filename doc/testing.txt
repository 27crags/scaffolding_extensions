If you are using Rails and want some basic generic tests, looking the test
folder for details on the Rails testing helper methods (e.g.
test_scaffold_all_models).

There is an automated test suite that tests the plugin against all supported web
frameworks and ORMs. It is now available in the same github repository as the
plugin itself.

It requires the ruby-sytle, hpricot, and mongrel gems (in addition to gems for
all of the frameworks and ORMs), and does black box testing of the plugin by
running a web crawler against a running application that uses the plugin.
