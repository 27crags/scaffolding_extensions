If you are using Rails and want some basic generic tests, looking the test
folder for details on the Rails testing helper methods (e.g.
test_scaffold_all_models).

There is an automated test suite that tests the plugin against all supported
web frameworks and ORMs.  You can get it via svn at:

  svn://code.jeremyevans.net/scaffolding_extensions_test
  
It requires the ruby-sytle, hpricot, and mongrel gems, and does black box
testing of the plugin by running a web crawler against a running application
that uses the plugin.
