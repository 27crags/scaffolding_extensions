Camping doesn't have a defined folder structure for models, so
scaffold_all_models shouldn't be used unless you pass the :only option, which
gives a list models to scaffold.

Camping also doesn't have a defined structure for plugins, so you'll need to
add scaffolding_extensions to the load path and then require it.  If you store
it in the root of the application, you could do this with:

$:.unshift('scaffolding_extensions/lib')
require 'scaffolding_extensions'

To use the plugin, inside your app's Controllers module, you need to define
a subclass of scaffold_R, and call one of the scaffold methods inside of it.
For example:

Camping.goes :Cse
module Cse::Controllers
  class Admin < scaffold_R("/admin")
    scaffold_all_models :only=>[Model1, Model2, Model3]
  end
end

The path given to scaffold_R will be the root of the plugin.
